NAME
    HACKING

DESCRIPTION
    General information if you wish to contribute to my projects.

  Thanks
    Firstly, thanks!

  Source Code Availability
    Generally speaking you should check out the latest copy of the code from
    the source repository rather than using the CPAN distribution. The file
    META.yml should contain a link to the source repository. If not, then
    try <https://bitbucket.org/tobyink> or e-mail <tobyink@cpan.org>.

    Many of my distributions are also mirrored at
    <http://github.com/tobyink>.

  Coding Style
    I tend to write using something approximating the Allman style, using
    tabs for indentation and Unix-style line breaks.

    *   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style>

    *   <http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html>

    I nominally encode all source files as UTF-8, though in practice most of
    them use a 7-bit-safe ASCII-compatible subset of UTF-8.

  Dependencies
    Since October 2011, most of my releases have targeted Perl 5.10.
