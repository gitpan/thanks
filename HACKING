HACKING
=======

Generally speaking you should check out the latest copy of the code from
the source repository rather than using the CPAN distribution. The file
META.yml should contain a link to the source repository. If not, then
try https://bitbucket.org/tobyink or e-mail tobyink@cpan.org.


Source code formatting and white space
--------------------------------------

I tend to write using something approximating the Allman style, using tabs
for indentation and Unix-style line breaks.

I nominally encode all source files as UTF-8, though in practice most of
them use a 7-bit-safe ASCII-compatible subset of UTF-8.


Dependencies
------------

Since October 2011, most of my releases have targeted Perl 5.10.
